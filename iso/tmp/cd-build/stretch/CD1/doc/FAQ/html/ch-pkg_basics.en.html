<h1>
The Debian GNU/Linux FAQ
<br>Chapter 7 - Basics of the Debian package management system
</h1>

<hr>

<p>
This chapter touches on some lower level internals of Debian package
management.  If you're interested mainly in <em>usage</em> of the relevant
tools, skip to chapters <a href="ch-pkgtools.en.html">The Debian package
management tools, Chapter 8</a> and/or <a href="ch-uptodate.en.html">Keeping
your Debian system up-to-date, Chapter 9</a>.
</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="s-package">7.1 What is a Debian package?</h2>

<p>
Packages generally contain all of the files necessary to implement a set of
related commands or features.  There are two types of Debian packages:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<em>Binary packages</em>, which contain executables, configuration files,
man/info pages, copyright information, and other documentation.  These packages
are distributed in a Debian-specific archive format (see <a
href="#s-deb-format">What is the format of a Debian binary package?, Section
7.2</a>); they are usually characterized by having a '.deb' file extension.
Binary packages can be unpacked using the Debian utility <samp>dpkg</samp>
(possibly via a frontend like <code>aptitude</code>); details are given in its
manual page.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<em>Source packages</em>, which consist of a <samp>.dsc</samp> file describing
the source package (including the names of the following files), a
<samp>.orig.tar.gz</samp> file that contains the original unmodified source in
gzip-compressed tar format and usually a <samp>.diff.gz</samp> file that
contains the Debian-specific changes to the original source.  The utility
<samp>dpkg-source</samp> packs and unpacks Debian source archives; details are
provided in its manual page.  (The program <code>apt-get</code> can be used as
a frontend for <samp>dpkg-source</samp>.)
</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Installation of software by the package system uses &quot;dependencies&quot;
which are carefully designed by the package maintainers.  These dependencies
are documented in the <samp>control</samp> file associated with each package.
For example, the package containing the GNU C compiler (<code>gcc</code>)
&quot;depends&quot; on the package <code>binutils</code> which includes the
linker and assembler.  If a user attempts to install <code>gcc</code> without
having first installed <code>binutils</code>, the package management system
(dpkg) will send an error message that it also needs <code>binutils</code>, and
stop installing <code>gcc</code>.  (However, this facility can be overridden by
the insistent user, see <code>dpkg(8)</code>.) See more in <a
href="#s-depends">What is meant by saying that a package <em>Depends</em>,
<em>Recommends</em>, <em>Suggests</em>, <em>Conflicts</em>, <em>Replaces</em>,
<em>Breaks</em> or <em>Provides</em> another package?, Section 7.9</a> below.
</p>

<p>
Debian's packaging tools can be used to:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
manipulate and manage packages or parts of packages,
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
administer local overrides of files in a package,

<h2 id="s-deb-format">7.2 What is the format of a Debian binary package?</h2>

<p>
A Debian &quot;package&quot;, or a Debian archive file, contains the executable
files, libraries, and documentation associated with a particular suite of
program or set of related programs.  Normally, a Debian archive file has a
filename that ends in <samp>.deb</samp>.
</p>

<p>
The internals of this Debian binary packages format are described in the
<code>deb(5)</code> manual page.  This internal format is subject to change
(between major releases of Debian GNU/Linux), therefore please always use
<code>dpkg-deb(1)</code> if you need to do lowlevel manipulations on
<samp>.deb</samp> files.
</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="s-pkgname">7.3 Why are Debian package file names so long?</h2>

<p>
The Debian binary package file names conform to the following convention:
&lt;foo&gt;_&lt;VersionNumber&gt;-&lt;DebianRevisionNumber&gt;_&lt;DebianArchitecture&gt;.deb
</p>

<p>
Note that <samp>foo</samp> is supposed to be the package name.  Checking the
package name associated with a particular Debian archive file (.deb file) can
be done in one of these ways:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
inspect the &quot;Packages&quot; file in the directory where it was stored at a
Debian FTP archive site.  This file contains a stanza describing each package;
the first field in each stanza is the formal package name.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
use the command <samp>dpkg --info foo_VVV-RRR_AAA.deb</samp> (where VVV, RRR
and AAA are the version, revision and architecture of the package in question,
respectively).  This displays, among other things, the package name
corresponding to the archive file being unpacked.
</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The <samp>VVV</samp> component is the version number specified by the upstream
developer.  There are no standards in place here, so the version number may
have formats as different as &quot;19990513&quot; and &quot;1.3.8pre1&quot;.
</p>

<p>
The <samp>RRR</samp> component is the Debian revision number, and is specified
by the Debian developer (or an individual user if he chooses to build the
package himself).  This number corresponds to the revision level of the Debian
package, thus, a new revision level usually signifies changes in the Debian
Makefile (<samp>debian/rules</samp>), the Debian control file
(<samp>debian/control</samp>), the installation or removal scripts
(<samp>debian/p*</samp>), or in the configuration files used with the package.
</p>

<p>
The <samp>AAA</samp> component identifies the processor for which the package
was built.  This is commonly <samp>amd64</samp>, which refers to AMD64, Intel
64 or VIA Nano chips.  For other possibilities review Debian's FTP directory
structure at <a href="ch-ftparchives.en.html#s-dirtree">What are all those
directories at the Debian FTP archives?, Section 6.7</a>.  For details, see the
description of &quot;Debian architecture&quot; in the manual page
<code>dpkg-architecture(1)</code>.

<h2 id="s-controlfile">7.4 What is a Debian control file?</h2>

<p>
Specifics regarding the contents of a Debian control file are provided in the
Debian Policy Manual, section 5, see <a
href="ch-support.en.html#s-debiandocs">What other documentation exists on and
for a Debian system?, Section 12.1</a>.
</p>

<p>
Briefly, a sample control file is shown below for the Debian package hello:
</p>

<pre>
     Package: hello
     Version: 2.9-2+deb8u1
     Architecture: amd64
     Maintainer: Santiago Vila &lt;sanvila@debian.org&gt;
     Installed-Size: 145
     Depends: libc6 (&gt;= 2.14)
     Conflicts: hello-traditional
     Breaks: hello-debhelper (&lt;&lt; 2.9)
     Replaces: hello-debhelper (&lt;&lt; 2.9), hello-traditional
     Section: devel
     Priority: optional
     Homepage: http://www.gnu.org/software/hello/
     Description: example package based on GNU hello
      The GNU hello program produces a familiar, friendly greeting.  It
      allows non-programmers to use a classic computer science tool which
      would otherwise be unavailable to them.
      .
      Seriously, though: this is an example of how to do a Debian package.
      It is the Debian version of the GNU Project's `hello world' program
      (which is itself an example for the GNU Project).
</pre>

<p>
The Package field gives the package name.  This is the name by which the
package can be manipulated by the package tools, and usually similar to but not
necessarily the same as the first component string in the Debian archive file
name.
</p>

<p>
The Version field gives both the upstream developer's version number and (in
the last component) the revision level of the Debian package of this program as
explained in <a href="#s-pkgname">Why are Debian package file names so long?,
Section 7.3</a>.
</p>

<p>
The Architecture field specifies the chip for which this particular binary was
compiled.
</p>

<p>
The Depends field gives a list of packages that have to be installed in order
to install this package successfully.
</p>

<p>
The Installed-Size indicates how much disk space the installed package will
consume.  This is intended to be used by installation front-ends in order to
show whether there is enough disk space available to install the program.
</p>

<p>
The Section line gives the &quot;section&quot; where this Debian package is
stored at the Debian FTP sites.
</p>

<p>
The Priority indicates how important is this package for installation, so that
semi-intelligent software like apt or aptitude can sort the package into a
category of e.g.  packages optionally installed.  See <a
href="#s-priority">What is an <em>Essential</em>, <em>Required</em>,
<em>Important</em>, <em>Standard</em>, <em>Optional</em>, or <em>Extra</em>
package?, Section 7.7</a>.
</p>

<p>
The Maintainer field gives the e-mail address of the person who is currently
responsible for maintaining this package.
</p>

<p>
The Description field gives a brief summary of the package's features.
</p>

<p>
For more information about all possible fields a package can have, please see
the Debian Policy Manual, section 5, &quot;Control files and their
fields&quot;, see <a href="ch-support.en.html#s-debiandocs">What other
documentation exists on and for a Debian system?, Section 12.1</a>.

<h2 id="s-conffile">7.5 What is a Debian conffile?</h2>

<p>
Conffiles is a list of configuration files (usually placed in
<samp>/etc</samp>) that the package management system will not overwrite when
the package is upgraded.  This ensures that local values for the contents of
these files will be preserved, and is a critical feature enabling the in-place
upgrade of packages on a running system.
</p>

<p>
To determine exactly which files are preserved during an upgrade, run:
</p>

<pre>
     dpkg --status package
</pre>

<p>
And look under &quot;Conffiles:&quot;.
</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="s-maintscripts">7.6 What is a Debian preinst, postinst, prerm, and postrm script?</h2>

<p>
These files are executable scripts which are automatically run before or after
a package is installed or removed.  Along with a file named
<samp>control</samp>, all of these files are part of the &quot;control&quot;
section of a Debian archive file.
</p>

<p>
The individual files are:
</p>
<dl>
<dt>preinst</dt>
<dd>
<p>
This script is executed before the package it belongs to is unpacked from its
Debian archive (&quot;.deb&quot;) file.  Many 'preinst' scripts stop services
for packages which are being upgraded until their installation or upgrade is
completed (following the successful execution of the 'postinst' script).
</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>postinst</dt>
<dd>
<p>
This script typically completes any required configuration of the package
<samp>foo</samp> once <samp>foo</samp> has been unpacked from its Debian
archive (&quot;.deb&quot;) file.  Often, 'postinst' scripts ask users for
input, and/or warn them that if they accept default values, they should
remember to go back and re-configure that package as needed.  Many 'postinst'
scripts then execute any commands necessary to start or restart a service once
a new package has been installed or upgraded.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>prerm</dt>
<dd>
<p>
This script typically stops any daemons which are associated with a package.
It is executed before the removal of files associated with the package.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>postrm</dt>
<dd>
<p>
This script typically modifies links or other files associated with
<samp>foo</samp>, and/or removes files created by the package.  (Also see <a
href="#s-virtual">What is a Virtual Package?, Section 7.8</a>.)
</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Currently all of the control files can be found in the directory
<samp>/var/lib/dpkg/info</samp>.  The files relevant to package
<samp>foo</samp> begin with the name &quot;foo&quot; and have file extensions
of &quot;preinst&quot;, &quot;postinst&quot;, etc., as appropriate.  The file
<samp>foo.list</samp> in that directory lists all of the files that were
installed with the package <samp>foo</samp>.  (Note that the location of these
files is a dpkg internal; you should not rely on it.)
</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="s-priority">7.7 What is an <em>Essential</em>, <em>Required</em>, <em>Important</em>, <em>Standard</em>, <em>Optional</em>, or <em>Extra</em> package?</h2>

<p>
Each Debian package is assigned a <em>priority</em> by the distribution
maintainers, as an aid to the package management system.  The priorities are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Required</strong>: packages that are necessary for the proper
functioning of the system.
</p>

<p>
This includes all tools that are necessary to repair system defects.  You must
not remove these packages or your system may become totally broken and you may
probably not even be able to use dpkg to put things back.  Systems with only
the Required packages are probably unusable, but they do have enough
functionality to allow the sysadmin to boot and install more software.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Important</strong> packages should be found on any Unix-like system.
</p>

<p>
Other packages which the system will not run well or be usable without will be
here.  This does <em>NOT</em> include Emacs or X or TeX or any other large
application.  These packages only constitute the bare infrastructure.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Standard</strong> packages are standard on any Linux system, including
a reasonably small but not too limited character-mode system.  Tools are
included to be able to send e-mail (with mutt) and download files from FTP
servers.
</p>

<p>
This is what will be installed by default if users do not select anything else.
It does not include many large applications, but it does include the Python
interpreter and some server software like OpenSSH (for remote administration)
and Exim (for mail delivery, although it can be configured for local delivery
only).  It also includes some common generic documentation that most users will
find helpful.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Optional</strong> packages include all those that you might reasonably
want to install if you do not know what they are, or that do not have
specialized requirements.
</p>

<p>
This includes X, a full TeX distribution, and lots of applications.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Extra</strong>: packages that either conflict with others with higher
priorities, are only likely to be useful if you already know what they are, or
have specialized requirements that make them unsuitable for
&quot;Optional&quot;.
</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
If you do a default Debian installation all the packages of priority
<strong>Standard</strong> or higher will be installed in your system.  If you
select pre-defined tasks you will get lower priority packages too.
</p>

<p>
Additionally, some packages are marked as <strong>Essential</strong> since they
are absolutely necessary for the proper functioning of the system.  The package
management tools will refuse to remove these.
</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="s-virtual">7.8 What is a Virtual Package?</h2>

<p>
A virtual package is a generic name that applies to any one of a group of
packages, all of which provide similar basic functionality.  For example, both
the <samp>konqueror</samp> and <samp>firefox-esr</samp> programs are web
browsers, and should therefore satisfy any dependency of a program that
requires a web browser on a system, in order to work or to be useful.  They are
therefore both said to provide the &quot;virtual package&quot; called
<samp>www-browser</samp>.
</p>

<p>
Similarly, <samp>exim4</samp> and <samp>sendmail</samp> both provide the
functionality of a mail transport agent.  They are therefore said to provide
the virtual package &quot;mail-transport-agent&quot;.  If either one is
installed, then any program depending on the installation of a
<samp>mail-transport-agent</samp> will be satisfied by the presence of this
virtual package.
</p>

<p>
Debian provides a mechanism so that, if more than one package which provide the
same virtual package is installed on a system, then system administrators can
set one as the preferred package.  The relevant command is
<samp>update-alternatives</samp>, and is described further in <a
href="ch-customizing.en.html#s-diverse">Some users like mawk, others like gawk;
some like vim, others like elvis; some like trn, others like tin; how does
Debian support diversity?, Section 11.11</a>.

<h2 id="s-depends">7.9 What is meant by saying that a package <em>Depends</em>, <em>Recommends</em>, <em>Suggests</em>, <em>Conflicts</em>, <em>Replaces</em>, <em>Breaks</em> or <em>Provides</em> another package?</h2>

<p>
The Debian package system has a range of package &quot;dependencies&quot; which
are designed to indicate (in a single flag) the level at which Program A can
operate independently of the existence of Program B on a given system:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Package A <em>depends</em> on Package B if B absolutely must be installed in
order to run A.  In some cases, A depends not only on B, but on a version of B.
In this case, the version dependency is usually a lower limit, in the sense
that A depends on any version of B more recent than some specified version.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Package A <em>recommends</em> Package B, if the package maintainer judges that
most users would not want A without also having the functionality provided by
B.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Package A <em>suggests</em> Package B if B contains files that are related to
(and usually enhance) the functionality of A.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Package A <em>conflicts</em> with Package B when A will not operate if B is
installed on the system.  Most often, conflicts are cases where A contains
files which are an improvement over those in B.  &quot;Conflicts&quot; are
often combined with &quot;replaces&quot;.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Package A <em>replaces</em> Package B when files installed by B are removed and
(in some cases) over-written by files in A.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Package A <em>breaks</em> Package B when both packages cannot be simultaneously
configured in a system.  The package management system will refuse to install
one if the other one is already installed and configured in the system.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Package A <em>provides</em> Package B when all of the files and functionality
of B are incorporated into A.  This mechanism provides a way for users with
constrained disk space to get only that part of package A which they really
need.
</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
More detailed information on the use of each of these terms can be found in the
Debian Policy manual, section 7.2, &quot;Binary Dependencies&quot;, see <a
href="ch-support.en.html#s-debiandocs">What other documentation exists on and
for a Debian system?, Section 12.1</a>.
</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="s-pre-depends">7.10 What is meant by Pre-Depends?</h2>

<p>
&quot;Pre-Depends&quot; is a special dependency.  In the case of most packages,
<samp>dpkg</samp> will unpack the archive file of a package (i.e., its
<samp>.deb</samp> file) independently of whether or not the files on which it
depends exist on the system.  Simplistically, unpacking means that
<samp>dpkg</samp> will extract the files from the archive file that were meant
to be installed on your file system, and put them in place.  If those packages
<em>depend</em> on the existence of some other packages on your system,
<samp>dpkg</samp> will refuse to complete the installation (by executing its
&quot;configure&quot; action) until the other packages are installed.
</p>

<p>
However, for some packages, <samp>dpkg</samp> will refuse even to unpack them
until certain dependencies are resolved.  Such packages are said to
&quot;Pre-depend&quot; on the presence of some other packages.  The Debian
project provided this mechanism to support the safe upgrading of systems from
<samp>a.out</samp> format to <samp>ELF</samp> format, where the <em>order</em>
in which packages were unpacked was critical.  There are other large upgrade
situations where this method is useful, e.g.  the packages with the required
priority and their LibC dependency.
</p>

<p>
As before, more detailed information about this can be found in the Policy
manual.
</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="s-pkgstatus">7.11 What is meant by <em>unknown</em>, <em>install</em>, <em>remove</em>, <em>purge</em> and <em>hold</em> in the package status?</h2>

<p>
These &quot;want&quot; flags tell what the user wanted to do with a package (as
indicated by the user's direct invocations of
<samp>dpkg</samp>/<samp>apt</samp>/ <samp>aptitude</samp>).
</p>

<p>
Their meanings are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
unknown - the user has never indicated whether the package is wanted.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
install - the user wants the package installed or upgraded.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
remove - the user wants the package removed, but does not want to remove any
existing configuration file.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
purge - the user wants the package to be removed completely, including its
configuration files.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
hold - the user wants this package not to be processed, i.e.  wants to keep the
current version with the current status whatever that is.
</p>
</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2 id="s-puttingonhold">7.12 How do I put a package on hold?</h2>

<p>
There are three ways of holding back packages, with dpkg, apt or aptitude.
</p>

<p>
With dpkg, you have to export the list of package selections, with:
</p>

<pre>
     dpkg --get-selections \* &gt; selections.txt
</pre>

<p>
Then edit the resulting file <code>selections.txt</code>, change the line
containing the package you wish to hold, e.g.  <code>libc6</code>, from this:
</p>

<pre>
     libc6                                           install
</pre>

<p>
to this:
</p>

<pre>
     libc6                                           hold
</pre>

<p>
Save the file, and reload it into dpkg database with:
</p>

<pre>
     dpkg --set-selections &lt; selections.txt
</pre>

<p>
With apt, you can set a package to hold using
</p>

<pre>
     apt-mark hold package_name
</pre>

<p>
and remove the hold with
</p>

<pre>
     apt-mark unhold package_name
</pre>

<p>
With aptitude, you can hold a package using
</p>

<pre>
     aptitude hold package_name
</pre>

<p>
and remove the hold with
</p>

<pre>
     aptitude unhold package_name
</pre>

<hr>

<h2 id="s-sourcepkgs">7.13 How do I install a source package?</h2>

<p>
Debian source packages can't actually be &quot;installed&quot;, they are just
unpacked in whatever directory you want to build the binary packages they
produce.
</p>

<p>
Source packages are distributed on most of the same mirrors where you can
obtain the binary packages.  If you set up your APT's
<code>sources.list(5)</code> to include the appropriate &quot;deb-src&quot;
lines, you'll be able to easily download any source package by running
</p>

<pre>
     apt-get source foo
</pre>

<p>
To help you in actually building the source package, Debian source packages
provide the so-called build-dependencies mechanism.  This means that the source
package maintainer keeps a list of other packages that are required to build
their package.  To see how this is useful, run
</p>

<pre>
     apt-get build-dep foo
</pre>

<p>
before building the source.
</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="s-sourcebuild">7.14 How do I build binary packages from a source package?</h2>

<p>
The preferred way to do this is by using various wrapper tools.  We'll show how
it's done using the <samp>devscripts</samp> tools.  Install this package if you
haven't done so already.
</p>

<p>
Now, first get the source package:
</p>

<pre>
     apt-get source foo
</pre>

<p>
and change to the source tree:
</p>

<pre>
     cd foo-*
</pre>

<p>
Then install needed build-dependencies (if any):
</p>

<pre>
     sudo apt-get build-dep foo
</pre>

<p>
Then create a dedicated version of your own build (so that you won't get
confused later when Debian itself releases a new version):
</p>

<pre>
     dch -l local 'Blah blah blah'
</pre>

<p>
And finally build your package:
</p>

<pre>
     debuild -us -uc
</pre>

<p>
If everything worked out fine, you should now be able to install your package
by running
</p>

<pre>
     sudo dpkg -i ../*.deb
</pre>

<p>
If you prefer to do things manually, and don't want to use
<samp>devscripts</samp>, follow this procedure:
</p>

<p>
You will need all of foo_*.dsc, foo_*.tar.gz and foo_*.diff.gz to compile the
source (note: there is no .diff.gz for some packages that are native to
Debian).
</p>

<p>
Once you have them (<a href="#s-sourcepkgs">How do I install a source package?,
Section 7.13</a>) and if you have the <code>dpkg-dev</code> package installed,
the following command:
</p>

<pre>
     dpkg-source -x foo_version-revision.dsc
</pre>

<p>
will extract the package into a directory called <samp>foo-version</samp>.
</p>

<p>
If you just want to compile the package, you may cd into the
<samp>foo-version</samp> directory and issue the command
</p>

<pre>
     dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot -b
</pre>

<p>
to build the package (note that this also requires the <code>fakeroot</code>
package), and then
</p>

<pre>
     dpkg -i ../foo_version-revision_arch.deb
</pre>

<p>
to install the newly-built package(s).
