<h1>
The Debian GNU/Linux FAQ
<br>Chapter 1 - Definitions and overview
</h1>

<hr>

<h2 id="s-whatisfaq">1.1 What is this FAQ?</h2>

<p>
This document gives frequently asked questions (with their answers!) about the
Debian distribution (Debian GNU/Linux and others) and about the Debian project.
If applicable, pointers to other documentation will be given: we won't quote
large parts of external documentation in this document.  You'll find out that
some answers assume some knowledge of Unix-like operating systems.  We'll try
to assume as little prior knowledge as possible: answers to general beginners
questions will be kept simple.
</p>

<p>
If you can't find what you're looking for in this FAQ, be sure to check out <a
href="ch-support.en.html#s-debiandocs">What other documentation exists on and
for a Debian system?, Section 12.1</a>.  If even that doesn't help, refer to <a
href="ch-faqinfo.en.html#s-feedback">Feedback, Section 16.2</a>.

<h2 id="s-whatisdebian">1.2 What is Debian GNU/Linux?</h2>

<p>
Debian GNU/Linux is a particular <em>distribution</em> of the Linux operating
system, and numerous packages that run on it.
</p>

<p>
Debian GNU/Linux is:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<strong>full featured</strong>: Debian includes more than 42551 software
packages at present.  Users can select which packages to install; Debian
provides a tool for this purpose.  You can find a list and descriptions of the
packages currently available in Debian at any of the Debian <code><a
href="http://www.debian.org/distrib/ftplist">mirror sites</a></code>.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<strong>free to use and redistribute</strong>: There is no consortium
membership or payment required to participate in its distribution and
development.  All packages that are formally part of Debian GNU/Linux are free
to redistribute, usually under terms specified by the GNU General Public
License.
</p>

Most Linux users run a specific <em>distribution</em> of Linux, like Debian
GNU/Linux.  However, in principle, users could obtain the Linux kernel via the
Internet or from elsewhere, and compile it themselves.  They could then obtain
source code for many applications in the same way, compile the programs, then
install them into their systems.  For complicated programs, this process can be
not only time-consuming but error-prone.  To avoid it, users often choose to
obtain the operating system and the application packages from one of the Linux
distributors.  What distinguishes the various Linux distributors are the
software, protocols, and practices they use for packaging, installing, and
tracking applications packages on users' systems, combined with installation
and maintenance tools, documentation, and other services.
</p>

<p>
Debian GNU/Linux is the result of a volunteer effort to create a free,
high-quality Unix-compatible operating system, complete with a suite of
applications.  The idea of a free Unix-like system originates from the GNU
project, and many of the applications that make Debian GNU/Linux so useful were
developed by the GNU project.
</p>

<p>
For Debian, free has the GNUish meaning (see the <code><a
href="http://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines">Debian Free Software
Guidelines</a></code>).  When we speak of free software, we are referring to
freedom, not price.  Free software means that you have the freedom to
distribute copies of free software, that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
</p>

<p>
The Debian Project was created by Ian Murdock in 1993, initially under the
sponsorship of the Free Software Foundation's GNU project.  Today, Debian's
developers think of it as a direct descendent of the GNU project.
</p>

<p>
Although Debian GNU/Linux itself is free software, it is a base upon which
value-added Linux distributions can be built.  By providing a reliable,
full-featured base system, Debian provides Linux users with increased
compatibility, and allows Linux distribution creators to eliminate duplication
of effort and focus on the things that make their distribution special.  See <a
href="ch-redistrib.en.html#s-childistro">I am making a special Linux
distribution for a &quot;vertical market&quot;.  Can I use Debian GNU/Linux for
the guts of a Linux system and add my own applications on top of it?, Section
14.3</a> for more information.
</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="s-linux">1.3 OK, now I know what Debian is... what is Linux?!</h2>

<p>
In short, Linux is the kernel of a Unix-like operating system.  It was
originally designed for 386 (and better) PCs; today Linux also runs on a dozen
of other systems.  Linux is written by Linus Torvalds and many computer
scientists around the world.
</p>

<p>
Besides its kernel, a &quot;Linux&quot; system usually has:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
a file system that follows the Linux Filesystem Hierarchy Standard <code><a
href="http://www.pathname.com/fhs/">http://www.pathname.com/fhs/</a></code>.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
a wide range of Unix utilities, many of which have been developed by the GNU
project and the Free Software Foundation.
</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The combination of the Linux kernel, the file system, the GNU and FSF
utilities, and the other utilities are designed to achieve compliance with the
POSIX (IEEE 1003.1) standard; see <a href="ch-compat.en.html#s-otherunices">How
source code compatible is Debian with other Unix systems?, Section 4.4</a>.
</p>

<p>

<h2 id="s-non-linux">1.4 Does Debian just do GNU/Linux?</h2>

<p>
Currently, Debian is only available for Linux, but with Debian GNU/Hurd and
Debian on BSD kernels, we have started to offer non-Linux-based OSes as a
development, server and desktop platform, too.  However, these non-linux ports
are not officially released yet.
</p>

<p>
The oldest porting effort is Debian GNU/Hurd.
</p>

<p>
The Hurd is a set of servers running on top of the GNU Mach microkernel.
Together they build the base for the GNU operating system.
</p>

<p>
Please see <code><a
href="http://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/">http://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/</a></code>
for more information about the GNU/Hurd in general, and <code><a
href="http://www.debian.org/ports/hurd/">http://www.debian.org/ports/hurd/</a></code>
for more information about Debian GNU/Hurd.
</p>

<p>
A second effort is the port to a BSD kernel.  People are working with the
FreeBSD kernel.
</p>

<p>
See <code><a
href="http://www.debian.org/ports/#nonlinux">http://www.debian.org/ports/#nonlinux</a></code>
for more information about these non-linux ports.

<h2 id="s-difference">1.5 What is the difference between Debian GNU/Linux and other Linux distributions? Why should I choose Debian over some other distribution?</h2>

<p>
These key features distinguish Debian from other Linux distributions:
</p>
<dl>
<dt>Freedom:</dt>
<dd>
<p>
As stated in the <code><a href="http://www.debian.org/social_contract">Debian
Social Contract</a></code>, Debian will remain 100% free.  Debian is very
strict about shipping truly free software.  The guidelines used to determine if
a work is &quot;free&quot; are provided in <code><a
href="http://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines">The Debian Free
Software Guidelines (DFSG)</a></code>.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>The Debian package maintenance system:</dt>
<dd>
<p>
The entire system, or any individual component of it, can be upgraded in place
without reformatting, without losing custom configuration files, and (in most
cases) without rebooting the system.  Most Linux distributions available today
have some kind of package maintenance system; the Debian package maintenance
system is unique and particularly robust (see <a
href="ch-pkg_basics.en.html">Basics of the Debian package management system,
Chapter 7</a>).
</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Open development:</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Whereas many other Linux distributions are developed by individuals, small,
closed groups, or commercial vendors, Debian is a major Linux distribution that
is being developed by an association of individuals who have made common cause
to create a free operating system, in the same spirit as Linux and other free
software.
</p>

<p>
More than 1033 volunteer package maintainers are working on over 42551 packages
and improving Debian GNU/Linux.  The Debian developers contribute to the
project not by writing new applications (in most cases), but by packaging
existing software according to the standards of the project, by communicating
bug reports to upstream developers, and by providing user support.  See also
additional information on how to become a contributor in <a
href="ch-contributing.en.html#s-contrib">How can I become a Debian
member/Debian developer?, Section 13.1</a>.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>The Universal Operating System:</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Debian comes with <code><a href="http://packages.debian.org/stable/">more than
42551 packages</a></code> and runs on <code><a
href="http://www.debian.org/ports/">10 architectures</a></code>.  This is far
more than is available for any other GNU/Linux distribution.  See <a
href="ch-software.en.html#s-apps">What types of applications and development
software are available for Debian GNU/Linux?, Section 5.1</a> for an overview
of the provided software and see <a href="ch-compat.en.html#s-arches">On what
hardware architectures/systems does Debian GNU/Linux run?, Section 4.1</a> for
a description of the supported hardware platforms.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>The Bug Tracking System:</dt>
<dd>
<p>
The geographical dispersion of the Debian developers required sophisticated
tools and quick communication of bugs and bug-fixes to accelerate the
development of the system.  Users are encouraged to send bugs in a formal
style, which are quickly accessible by WWW archives or via e-mail.  See
additional information in this FAQ on the management of the bug log in <a
href="ch-support.en.html#s-buglogs">Are there logs of known bugs?, Section
12.4</a>.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>The Debian Policy:</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Debian has an extensive specification of our standards of quality, the Debian
Policy.  This document defines the qualities and standards to which we hold
Debian packages.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<h2 id="s-gnu">1.6 How does the Debian project fit in or compare with the Free Software Foundation's GNU project?</h2>

<p>
The Debian system builds on the ideals of free software first championed by the
<code><a href="http://www.gnu.org/">Free Software Foundation</a></code> and in
particular by <code><a href="http://www.stallman.org/">Richard
Stallman</a></code>.  FSF's powerful system development tools, utilities, and
applications are also a key part of the Debian system.
</p>

<p>
The Debian Project is a separate entity from the FSF, however we communicate
regularly and cooperate on various projects.  The FSF explicitly requested that
we call our system &quot;Debian GNU/Linux&quot;, and we are happy to comply
with that request.
</p>

<p>
The FSF's long-standing objective is to develop a new operating system called
GNU, based on <code><a
href="http://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/">Hurd</a></code>.  Debian is working
with FSF on this system, called <code><a
href="http://www.debian.org/ports/hurd/">Debian GNU/Hurd</a></code>.
</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="s-pronunciation">1.7 How does one pronounce Debian and what does this word mean?</h2>

<p>
The project name is pronounced Deb'-ee-en, with a short e in Deb, and emphasis
on the first syllable.  This word is a contraction of the names of Debra and
Ian Murdock, who founded the project.  (Dictionaries seem to offer some
ambiguity in the pronunciation of Ian (!), but Ian prefers ee'-en.)
