<h1>
The Debian GNU/Linux FAQ
<br>Chapter 9 - Keeping your Debian system up-to-date
</h1>

<hr>

<p>
One of Debian's goals is to provide a consistent upgrade path and a secure
upgrade process.  We always do our best to make upgrading to new releases a
smooth procedure.  In case there's some important note to add to the upgrade
process, the packages will alert the user, and often provide a solution to a
possible problem.
</p>

<p>
You should also read the Release Notes document that describes the details of
specific upgrades.  It is available on the Debian website at <code><a
href="http://www.debian.org/releases/stable/releasenotes">http://www.debian.org/releases/stable/releasenotes</a></code>
and is also shipped on the Debian CDs, DVDs and Blu-ray discs.
</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="s-howtocurrent">9.1 How can I keep my Debian system current?</h2>

<p>
One could simply execute an anonymous ftp call to a Debian archive, then peruse
the directories until one finds the desired file, and then fetch it, and
finally install it using <samp>dpkg</samp>.  Note that <samp>dpkg</samp> will
install upgrade files in place, even on a running system.  Sometimes, a revised
package will require the installation of a newly revised version of another
package, in which case the installation will fail until/unless the other
package is installed.
</p>

<p>
Many people find this approach much too time-consuming, since Debian evolves so
quickly -- typically, a dozen or more new packages are uploaded every week.
This number is larger just before a new major release.  To deal with this
avalanche, many people prefer to use a more automated method.  Several
different packages are available for this purpose:
</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="s-aptitude-upgrade">9.1.1 aptitude</h3>

<p>
<code>aptitude</code> is the recommended package manager for Debian GNU/Linux
systems, and is described in <a href="ch-pkgtools.en.html#s-aptitude">aptitude,
Section 8.1.3</a>.
</p>

<p>
Before you can use <code>aptitude</code> to make an upgrade, you'll have to
edit the <samp>/etc/apt/sources.list</samp> file to set it up.  If you wish to
upgrade to the latest stable version of Debian, you'll probably want to use a
source like this one:
</p>

<pre>
     http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian stable main contrib
</pre>

<p>
You can replace ftp.us.debian.org (the mirror in the United States) with the
name of a faster Debian mirror near you.  See the mirror list at <code><a
href="http://www.debian.org/mirror/list">http://www.debian.org/mirror/list</a></code>
for more information.
</p>

<p>
Or you can use the redirector service httpredir.debian.org which aims to solve
the problem of choosing a Debian mirror.  It uses the geographic location of
the user and other information to choose the best mirror that can serve the
files.  To take advantage of it use a source like this one:
</p>

<pre>
     http://httpredir.debian.org/debian stable main contrib
</pre>

<p>
More details on this can be found in the <code>sources.list(5)</code> manual
page.
</p>

<p>
To update your system from the command line, run
</p>

<pre>
     aptitude update
</pre>

<p>
followed by
</p>

<pre>
     aptitude full-upgrade
</pre>

<p>
Answer any questions that might come up, and your system will be upgraded.
</p>

<p>
Note that <code>aptitude</code> is not the recommended tool for doing upgrades
from one Debian GNU/Linux release to another.  Use <code>apt-get</code>
instead.  For upgrades between releases you should read the <code><a
href="http://www.debian.org/releases/stable/releasenotes">Release
Notes</a></code>.  This document describes in detail the recommended steps for
upgrades from previous releases as well as known issues you should consider
before upgrading.
</p>

<p>
For details, see the manual page <code>aptitude(8)</code>, and the file
<code>/usr/share/aptitude/README</code>.

<h3 id="s-apt">9.1.2 apt-get and apt-cdrom</h3>

<p>
An alternative to <code>aptitude</code> is <code>apt-get</code> which is an
APT-based command-line tool (described previously in <a
href="ch-pkgtools.en.html#s-apt-get">APT, Section 8.1.2</a>).
</p>

<p>
<code>apt-get</code>, the APT-based command-line tool for handling packages,
provides a simple, safe way to install and upgrade packages.
</p>

<p>
To use <code>apt-get</code>, edit the <samp>/etc/apt/sources.list</samp> file
to set it up, just as for <a href="#s-aptitude-upgrade">aptitude, Section
9.1.1</a>.
</p>

<p>
Then run
</p>

<pre>
     apt-get update
</pre>

<p>
followed by
</p>

<pre>
     apt-get dist-upgrade
</pre>

<p>
Answer any questions that might come up, and your system will be upgraded.  See
also the <code>apt-get(8)</code> manual page, as well as <a
href="ch-pkgtools.en.html#s-apt-get">APT, Section 8.1.2</a>.
</p>

<p>
If you want to use CDs/DVDs/BDs to install packages, you can use
<code>apt-cdrom</code>.  For details, please see the Release Notes, section
&quot;Adding APT sources from optical media&quot;.
</p>

<p>
Please note that when you get and install the packages, you'll still have them
kept in your /var directory hierarchy.  To keep your partition from
overflowing, remember to delete extra files using <samp>apt-get clean</samp>
and <samp>apt-get autoclean</samp>, or to move them someplace else (hint: use
<code>apt-move</code>).
</p>

<h3 id="s-mirror">9.1.3 mirror</h3>

<p>
This Perl script, and its (optional) manager program called
<code>mirror-master</code>, can be used to fetch user-specified parts of a
directory tree from a specified host <em>via</em> anonymous FTP.
</p>

<p>
<code>mirror</code> is particularly useful for downloading large volumes of
software.  After the first time files have been downloaded from a site, a file
called <samp>.mirrorinfo</samp> is stored on the local host.  Changes to the
remote file system are tracked automatically by <code>mirror</code>, which
compares this file to a similar file on the remote system and downloads only
changed files.
</p>

<p>
The <code>mirror</code> program is generally useful for updating local copies
of remote directory trees.  The files fetched need not be Debian files.  (Since
<code>mirror</code> is a Perl script, it can also run on non-Unix systems.)
Though the <code>mirror</code> program provides mechanisms for excluding files
with names matching user-specified strings, this program is most useful when
the objective is to download whole directory trees, rather than selected
packages.
</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="s-upgradesingle">9.2 Must I go into single user mode in order to upgrade a package?</h2>

<p>
No.  Packages can be upgraded in place, even in running systems.  Debian has a
<samp>start-stop-daemon</samp> program that is invoked to stop, then restart
running process if necessary during a package upgrade.
</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="s-savedebs">9.3 Do I have to keep all those .deb archive files on my disk?</h2>

<p>
No.  If you have downloaded the files to your disk then after you have
installed the packages, you can remove them from your system, e.g.  by running
<samp>aptitude clean</samp>.
</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="s-keepingalog">9.4 How can I keep a log of the packages I added to the system? I'd like to know when upgrades and removals have occurred and on which packages!</h2>

<p>
Passing the <samp>--log</samp>-option to <code>dpkg</code> makes
<code>dpkg</code> log status change updates and actions.  It logs both the
<code>dpkg</code>-invokation (e.g.
</p>

<pre>
     2005-12-30 18:10:33 install hello 1.3.18 2.1.1-4
</pre>

<p>
) and the results (e.g.
</p>

<pre>
     2005-12-30 18:10:35 status installed hello 2.1.1-4
</pre>

<p>
) If you'd like to log all your <code>dpkg</code> invocations (even those done
using frontends like <code>aptitude</code>), you could add
</p>

<pre>
     log /var/log/dpkg.log
</pre>

<p>
to your <code>/etc/dpkg/dpkg.cfg</code>.  Be sure the created logfile gets
rotated periodically.  If you're using <code>logrotate</code>, this can be
achieved by creating a file <code>/etc/logrotate.d/dpkg</code> with the
following lines
</p>

<pre>
     /var/log/dpkg {
       missingok
       notifempty
     }
</pre>

<p>
More details on <code>dpkg</code> logging can be found in the
<code>dpkg(1)</code> manual page.
</p>

<p>
<code>aptitude</code> logs the package installations, removals, and upgrades
that it intends to perform to <code>/var/log/aptitude</code>.  Note that the
<em>results</em> of those actions are not recorded in this file!
</p>

<p>
Another way to record your actions is to run your package management session
within the <code>script(1)</code> program.
</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="s-autoupdate">9.5 Can I automatically update the system?</h2>

<p>
Yes.  You can use <code>cron-apt</code>; this tool updates the system at
regular intervals using a cron job.  By default it just updates the package
list and downloads new packages, but without installing them.
</p>

<p>
Note: Automatic upgrade of packages is <strong>NOT</strong> recommended in
<em>testing</em> or <em>unstable</em> systems as this might bring unexpected
behaviour and remove packages without notice.
</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="s-aptcacher">9.6 I have several machines; how can I download the updates only one time?</h2>

<p>
If you have more than one Debian machine on your network, it is useful to use
<code>apt-cacher</code> to keep all of your Debian systems up-to-date.
</p>

<p>
<code>apt-cacher</code> reduces the bandwidth requirements of Debian mirrors by
restricting the frequency of Packages, Releases and Sources file updates from
the back end and only doing a single fetch for any file, independently of the
actual request from the proxy.  <code>apt-cacher</code> automatically builds a
Debian HTTP mirror based on requests which pass through the proxy.
</p>

<p>
Of course, you can get the same benefit if you are already using a standard
caching proxy and all your systems are configured to use it.
</p>
