# these are the basic debconf pre-seeding items needed for a miminal
# interaction debian etch install using debian-installer

# this example pre-seeding file was largely based on
# http://d-i.alioth.debian.org/manual/example-preseed.txt
#
# for more explanation of the options, see:
# http://d-i.alioth.debian.org/manual/en.mips/apbs04.html

## simple-cdd options

# automatically select simple-cdd profiles
# NOTE: profile "default" is now automatically included, and should not be
# specified here.
#simple-cdd simple-cdd/profiles multiselect ltsp
#simple-cdd simple-cdd/profiles multiselect ltsp, x-basic


###### Package selection.

# You can choose to install any combination of tasks that are available.
# Available tasks as of this writing include: Desktop environment,
# Web server, Print server, DNS server, File server, Mail server,

tasksel   tasksel/first multiselect 
#tasksel   tasksel/first multiselect Desktop environment

###### Time zone setup.

# Controls whether or not the hardware clock is set to UTC.
d-i clock-setup/utc boolean true

# Many countries have only one time zone. If you told the installer you're
# in one of those countries, you can choose its standard time zone via this
# question.
base-config tzconfig/choose_country_zone_single boolean true
#d-i     time/zone       select  US/Pacific

###### Account setup.

# To preseed the root password, you have to put it in the clear in this
# file. That is not a very good idea, use caution!
#passwd   passwd/root-password    password r00tme
#passwd   passwd/root-password-again  password r00tme

# If you want to skip creation of a normal user account.

#### Network configuration.

# netcfg will choose an interface that has link if possible. This makes it
# skip displaying a list if there is more than one interface.
d-i netcfg/choose_interface select auto

# Note that any hostname and domain names assigned from dhcp take
# precidence over values set here. However, setting the values still
# prevents the questions from being shown even if values come from dhcp.
d-i netcfg/get_hostname string unassigned
d-i netcfg/get_domain string unassigned
# to set the domain to empty:
#d-i netcfg/get_domain string

# In addition, you'll need to specify the method to use.
# The presently available methods are: "regular", "lvm" and "crypto"
d-i partman-auto/method string regular

# If one of the disks that are going to be automatically partitioned
# contains an old LVM configuration, the user will normally receive a
# warning. This can be preseeded away...
#d-i partman-auto/purge_lvm_from_device boolean true
# And the same goes for the confirmation to write the lvm partitions.
#d-i partman-lvm/confirm boolean true

# Alternately, If the system has free space you can choose to only partition
# that space.
#d-i  partman-auto/init_automatically_partition select Use the largest continuous free space
#d-i partman-auto/init_automatically_partition       select  Guided - use entire disk

# You can choose from any of the predefined partitioning recipes:
d-i partman-auto/choose_recipe  select All files in one partition (recommended for new users)
#d-i  partman-auto/choose_recipe  select Desktop machine
#d-i  partman-auto/choose_recipe  select Multi-user workstation

# uncomment the following three values to makes partman automatically partition
# without confirmation.
#d-i partman/confirm_write_new_label boolean true
d-i partman/choose_partition  select Finish partitioning and write changes to disk
#d-i partman/confirm     boolean true

#### Boot loader installation.

# This is fairly safe to set, it makes grub install automatically to the MBR
# if no other operating system is detected on the machine.
d-i grub-installer/only_debian  boolean true

# too, which is less safe as it might not be able to boot that other OS.

#d-i apt-setup/non-free  boolean true
#d-i apt-setup/contrib boolean true


###### Mailer configuration.

# During a normal install, exim asks only two questions. Here's how to
# avoid even those. More complicated preseeding is possible.
exim4-config  exim4/dc_eximconfig_configtype  select no configuration at this time
# It's a good idea to set this to whatever user account you choose to
# create. Leaving the value blank results in postmaster mail going to
# /var/mail/mail.
exim4-config  exim4/dc_postmaster   string
