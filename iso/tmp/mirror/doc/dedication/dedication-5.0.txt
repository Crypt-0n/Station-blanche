Lenny dedicated to Thiemo Seufer
--------------------------------

The Debian Project has lost an active member of its community. Thiemo Seufer 
died on December 26th, 2008 in a tragic car accident.

Thiemo was involved in Debian in many ways. He maintained several packages 
and was the main supporter of the Debian ports to the MIPS architecture. He was
also a member of our kernel team, as well as a member of the Debian Installer
team. His contributions reached far beyond the Debian project: he also worked
on the MIPS port of the Linux kernel, the MIPS emulation of qemu, and far too
many smaller projects to be named here.

Thiemo's work, dedication, broad technical knowledge and ability to share this 
with others will be missed. His contributions will not be forgotten.
The high standards of Thiemo's work make it hard to pick up.

To honour his contributions to Debian, the project dedicates the release of
Debian GNU/Linux 5.0 "Lenny" to Thiemo.
